# A MongoDB-based store for Quartz.

## FAQ

### Project Origins

The project was originally started by MuleSoft. It supports all Quartz trigger types and
tries to be as feature complete as possible.

### Why the Fork?

MuleSoft developers did not respond to attempts to submit pull
requests for several months. As more and more functionality was added
and implementation code refactored, I decided to completely separate
this fork form GitHub forks network because the project is now too
different from the original one. All changes were made with respect to
the Apache Public License 2.0.
